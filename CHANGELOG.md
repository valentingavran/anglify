### [0.18.1](https://github.com/valentingavran/anglify/compare/v0.18.0...v0.18.1) (2022-05-19)


### üêõ  Bug Fixes

* replace absolute paths inside bottom navigation component ([d7101e1](https://github.com/valentingavran/anglify/commit/d7101e145206324f74793c4ca294834ac2dfc58d))

## [0.18.0](https://github.com/valentingavran/anglify/compare/v0.17.2...v0.18.0) (2022-05-13)


### ‚ö† BREAKING CHANGES

* Themes are now mixins and do not manipulate the root element directly. At the point where you want
to add the theme variables, you must now call the mixin with `@include light-theme;`

    ```scss
    @use 'node_modules/@anglify/components/styles/themes/light' as *;

    :root {
        @include light-theme;
    }
    ```
- Removal of `elevated` button style.
  - There is no reason for us to do this, we can already use the elevation utility for this.
- Rename of `filled` button style to `contained` as per material spec.
- Removal of `filled-tonal` button style.
  - We can already handle changing the button color and text color within just a certain button
    really easily, no need to do this.
- Removal of `sizing` property on buttons.
  - We can handle changing the button size with CSS rather easily too, no need to do all out here
    and change it weirdly with props to have 5 fixed sizes.
- Removal of `sizing` property on fab buttons.
  - See above.
