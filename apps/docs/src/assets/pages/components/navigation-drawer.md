Navigation drawers provide access to destinations and app functionality, such as switching accounts. They can either be permanently
on-screen or controlled by a navigation menu icon. Navigation drawers are recommended for:

- Apps with five or more top-level destinations
- Apps with two or more levels of navigation hierarchy
- Quick navigation between unrelated destinations
