<p>
  A dialog is a type of modal window that appears in front of app content to provide critical information or ask for a decision. Dialogs
  disable all app functionality when they appear, and remain on screen until confirmed, dismissed, or a required action has been taken.
</p>
<p>Dialogs are purposefully interruptive, so they should be used sparingly.</p>
