<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>If you have not already created a new Angular project, you can do so by typing:</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="angularInstallation" [languages]="['shell']"></code>
</pre>
<p>
  If you need more information on this topic, you can visit the official
  <a href="https://angular.io/cli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angular CLI</a> documentation or read through
  <a href="https://angular.io/start" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angular's Getting Started Guide</a>.
</p>

<p>Now that you have an instantiated project, you can install the Anglify package.</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="anglifyInstallation" [languages]="['shell']"></code>
</pre>

<p>After that you only have to import the common Anglify styles into your <code>styles.scss</code> file:</p>

<pre>
  <code [highlight]="addCommonStyles" [languages]="['scss']"></code>
</pre>

<p>Now you are ready to use the numerous Anglify components.</p>

<h2>Using components</h2>

<p>
  In order to use a Anglify component, you first need to import the respective component module. To do this, open the module in which your
  component is defined and in which you want to use an Anglify component.
</p>
<p>After that you import the desired Anglify module and add it to the <code>imports</code> array:</p>

<pre>
  <code [highlight]="importingModules" [languages]="['typescript']"></code>
</pre>

<p>Finally, you can start using the component in the template:</p>

<pre>
  <code [highlight]="usingComponents" [languages]="['xml']"></code>
</pre>
